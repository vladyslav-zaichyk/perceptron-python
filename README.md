This program is trying to guess witch text color (black or white) is better suited for background color. You can pick it randomly or manually with color picker.

You can train the perceptron in runtime by clicking `Wrong guess`button.

There are some tuned weights already in `weights.data`, but you can delete the file and tune them by yourself (please, do this, I'm lazy and my weights are bad). You also may want to change learning rate (there is const variable in `main.py`for this).

And, shout-out to [Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/shiffman). He's cool.
